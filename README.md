Here's how to create a Django project using the command line: 
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory: where you want to create your project. For example:
Code

    cd path/to/your/projects
Create the Django project: using the django-admin startproject command, followed by your desired project name:
Code

    django-admin startproject myproject
Replace myproject with your chosen project name. This command sets up the basic directory structure and files for a new Django project.
Navigate into the newly created project directory:
Code

    cd myproject
Run the development server: to verify your project setup:
Code

    python manage.py runserver
